# About
Within the first week of learning node I wrote this module. It sorts the files in `/files/` into there `mime` types.

Just dump a whole heap of files into the `/files/` folder and run `npm run sort-files` twice.

There's a bug which requires you to run `npm run sort-files` twice...I created this over a year ago & I'm simply just uploading the code to `github`.

# Other
There is also a script `npm run sort-txtFile` which reads the txtfile and spits out two arrays. 1 with the numbers & 1 with the words. Idk why this is in here, but it is :P So I'll just leave it.
