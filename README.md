# About
Within the first week of learning node I wrote this module. It sorts the files in `/testFolder/` into there `mime` types.

Just dump a whole heap of files into the `/testFolder/` folder and run `npm run sort-files` twice. I initially added files so you could just run the project, but now they've been removed. So just add a whole bunch of them in the `testFolder`

There's a bug which requires you to run `npm run sort-files` twice...I created this over a year ago & I'm simply just uploading the code to `github`. I'm sure it's easy to fix too.

I've uploaded the node-modules folder just in case as the package versions are really old (I'm not sure if they still exist or not either) and it's only 214kb in size.



# Other
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ There is also a script `npm run sort-txtFile` which reads the txtfile and spits out two arrays. 1 with the numbers & 1 with the words. Idk why this is in here, but it is :P So I'll just leave it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
